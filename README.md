## a-4 React To-do site

Was too large to deploy on a site, I tried glitch and render and their file size max was too small for this. But anyways I took my a2 which was a to do list with barely any styling and no java script and I created a new and imporved to do list. I also decided to include GitHub OAuth for login that is fully functional. This included creating a server and client side, react on client and express + axios for server side. To start you need to cd into client and type npm start, at the same time in a different terminal cd into server and run node server.js.
